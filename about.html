    <h1>About Vincent Van Gogh</h1>
    <img src="img/vincent-van-gogh-self-portrait.jpg" alt="[Vincent Van Gogh Self Portrait]">
    <p>Vincent Van Gogh was born on March 30th, 1853. The painting you see above you is a self portrait of Vincent Van Gogh. He became an artist when he was 27. During his lifetime, he never became famous. He struggled with mental health for the majority of his life. It got really bad to the point where he actually cut off his left ear. It could be argued that his artwork was the only thing that kept him sane. He died on July 29, 1890 from suicide. This website is to show off just some of the work that the iconic artist made, whether that be his drawings or paintings.</p>
